# Botnets and the Internet of Things

## Botnets
### The fuck is a botnet?
* a botnet is a network of computers which have been infected with malware, allowing them to be remotely controlled.  
* botnets can consist of hundreds of thousands (even millions) of computers
* the infected computer becomes a part of the botnet when it is in contact with a remote server, or other bots, and takes commands from whoever is in control of the botnet
* the botnet's creator can decide what to do with the botnet later (download other types of malware or have the bots act together)

### What can you even do with a botnet?
* Many different purposes...
* a very common and profitable purpose is to have the bots act in unison to perform a DDOS attack on a web server
  * Hundreds, thousands, even hundreds of thousands (some resources report botnets controlling millions of machines) of computers would bombard a website with traffic at the same time, overloading it and causing it to perform poorly or be unreachable for people who actually need it.

  * $150 can buy a week-long DDoS attack on the black market, capable of shutting down the online resources of a small organization
  * More than 2000 DDoS attacks are observed daily (world-wide)
  * 1/3 of all downtime incidents are attributed to DDoS attacks

## The Internet of Things (IoT)
### What the iota huh?
* the internetworking of physical devices, vehicles, buildings, items that exchange data
  * items embedded with electronics, software, sensors, actuators, and network connectivity that enables these objects to collect and exchange data
* The Global Standards Initiative on Internet of Things defined the IoT as "the infrastructure for the information society"
* Estimated that the IoT will consist of almost 50 billion objects by 20202

### Okay... but what are the things?

  * "Smartphones, navigation, and a stereo system are enough for the average drive. But spotty network reception can take a toll on a longer trip, leaving happy wanderers directionless and in silence, desperate to drive back into range before the kids wake up and need to stream a movie on their tablets for distraction."

  * What good is a fitness tracker if you can't easily access the data it is collecting of you?

  * A good thermostat can save you money on power, keep your home comfortable, even learn your habits and preferences.
* While these examples are consumer devices, there are also factory control devices and medical devices which send and receive information over the internet.

### Neat, what's your point?

* IoT is made of a wide range of device types, small to large, from consumer gadgets to sophisticated systems being utilized by the Department of Defense, utility and industrial/manufacturing systems.
* Due to the specialized nature of embedded systems, typical computer/ network security solutions won't even run on most embedded devices
* the majority of these embedded devices rely on simple password authentication and security protocols because it was assumed that embedded devices are not an attractive target to hackers
